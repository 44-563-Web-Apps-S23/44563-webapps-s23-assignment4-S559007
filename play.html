            OLLIVANT. [_Affectionately._] Glad to be home again, Mary?</p>

        <p>MARY. [_Evasively._] The garden is so pretty.</p>

        <p>OLLIVANT. Hasn't changed much, eh?</p>

        <p>MARY. It seems different; perhaps it's the night.</p>

        <p>OLLIVANT. I guess it isn't up to its usual standard. Haven't seen your
        mother there so often this spring.</p>

        <p>EMILY. [_Quietly._] This dry spell is not good for flowers.</p>

        <p>OLLIVANT. It's only the cultivated flowers that need care; can't help
        thinking that when I see the wild ones so hardy in my fields on the
        hill. [_Turning to_ EMILY _and patting her_.] Is there any of that spray
        mixture left, Emily, dear?

        EMILY. I haven't looked lately.</p>
